Hello, hello, Quantum team!
Here you can see the results of my work on the test task.
1. In the file task1.py is the code for performing the first task, I think the condition is quite clear, so there are no unnecessary comments here.
2. In the file task2.py, the code for solving the second task. The dfs function performs a depth-first search starting from a given cell (i,j) on the grid, marking all cells that belong to the same island as visited. The count_islands function applies the dfs function to each unvisited cell on the grid that is land, incrementing a counter for each island that is found. The main program reads the input matrix from the user, calls the count_islands function, and prints the result.

This implementation should be efficient enough to handle reasonably large input sizes, since it performs a single depth-first search for each island and doesn't revisit any cells that have already been visited.

3. The results of the 3 tasks are in the Regression_problem_on_tabular_data folder. There are all the necessary files and the corresponding README.

4. Results of 4 tasks are in the Soil_erosion_detection folder. There are all the necessary files and the corresponding README.

Finally, I want to say that I am very satisfied with your task, very interesting tasks and serious challenges. Although I did not have enough time and ability to complete it in full on time, I will definitely complete it to the end for my own experience. Thanks for the opportunity. Good luck!
